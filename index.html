		Hi, I'm Joshua Martinez !
	</h1>

	<p>
			I'm a CS Student studying at <a href="myUniversity.html"> Rutgers University - Newark </a>
			<br> <br>
			I'm an international student from the Philippines, and I've been living here for around three years.<br>
			My strong passion for problem-solving and science led me to choose Computer Science as my primary major.<br><br>

			I'm also an avid comic reader, enjoying Manga (Japanese comics), Manhwa (Korean comics), and Webtoons (digital comics).<br><br>

			In addition, I have a deep interest in space exploration, video games, and art.<br>
